docs {
  This is a PUT request and it is used to overwrite an existing piece of data. For instance, after you create an entity with a POST request, you may want to modify that later. You can do that using a PUT request. You typically identify the entity being updated by including an identifier in the URL (eg. `id=1`).
  
  A successful PUT request typically returns a `200 OK`, `201 Created`, or `204 No Content` response code.
